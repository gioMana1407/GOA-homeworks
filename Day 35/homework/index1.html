        <p>Alex (birthname Alakay) is the overall main protagonist and one of the main characters in the Madagascar
            franchise. He is an African lion who, for a short time, was raised in an African wildlife reserve (In
            Madagascar), before being captured by poachers, and eventually ended up falling out of the poachers' truck

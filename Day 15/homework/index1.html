        <p><u>Life Is Beautiful </u>(Italian: La vita è bella, Italian: [la ˈviːta ˈɛ bˈbɛlla]) is a 1997 Italian
            comedy-drama film directed by and starring Roberto Benigni, who co-wrote the film with Vincenzo Cerami.
            Benigni plays Guido Orefice, a Jewish Italian bookshop owner, who employs his imagination to shield his son
            from the horrors of internment in a Nazi concentration camp. The film was partially inspired by the book In
            the End, I Beat Hitler by Rubino Romeo Salmonì and by Benigni's father, who spent two years in the
            Bergen-Belsen concentration camp during World War II.

            The film was an overwhelming critical and commercial success. Despite some criticisms of using the subject
            matter for comedic purposes, it received widespread acclaim, with critics praising its story, performances
            and direction, and the union of drama and comedy. The movie grossed over $230 million worldwide, including
            $57.6 million in the United States, is the second highest-grossing foreign language film in the U.S. (after
            Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon)[4] and one of the highest-grossing non-English language movies of all
            time.[5] The National Board of Review included it in the top five best foreign films of 1998.[6]

            The movie won the Grand Prix at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival, nine David di Donatello Awards (including
            Best Film), five Nastro d'Argento Awards in Italy, two European Film Awards, and three Academy Awards,
            including Best Foreign Language Film and Best Actor for Benigni, the first for a male non-English
            performance.[7]</p>

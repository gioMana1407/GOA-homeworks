    <p>Robert "Rocky" Balboa (born July 6, 1945[citation needed]) (also known by his ring name the Italian Stallion) is
        a fictional character and the titular protagonist of the Rocky film series. The character was created by
        Sylvester Stallone, who has also portrayed him in eight of the nine films in the franchise. He is depicted as a
        working class or poor Italian-American from the slums of Philadelphia who started out as a club fighter and
        "enforcer" for a local Philly Mafia loan shark. He is portrayed as overcoming the obstacles that had occurred in
        his life and in his career as a professional boxer.

        While the story of his first film was partly inspired by a 1975 fight between underdog Chuck Wepner and
        heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali (which nearly went the 15 round distance despite the odds), the inspiration
        for the name, iconography and fighting style came from boxing legend Rocco Francis "Rocky Marciano" Marchegiano,
        though his surname coincidentally also resembles that of Middleweight Boxing Champion Thomas Rocco "Rocky
        Graziano" Barbella.</p>

    <p>Robert "Rocky" Balboa was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on July 6, 1945.[citation needed] He was the only
        child in a Roman Catholic, Italian-American or Italian immigrant family.[a] Rocky appears to be fully or
        semi-fluent in the Italian language; when Rocky is spoken to in Italian by his priest, Father Carmine, it is
        apparent that Rocky understands the language very well or fluently, including in a scene in which he translates
        Italian into English for Tommy Gunn. However, despite Rocky's obvious understanding of Italian, it is unclear
        and undetermined how well he actually speaks the language, as his responses to Father Carmine are always in
        English.

        During the scene in Rocky in which Rocky takes Adrianna "Adrian" Pennino skating on Thanksgiving, he tells her,
        "Yeah â€“ My old man, who was never the sharpest, told me I weren't born with much brain, so I better use my
        body." This encouraged him to take up boxing. He trained very hard so he could grow up to be like his idol Rocky
        Marciano. Unable to live on the low pay of club fights, and being unable to find work anywhere else, Rocky got a
        job as a collector for Tony Gazzo, the local loan shark, to make ends meet. By the end of 1975, Rocky had fought
        in 64 fights, winning 43 (40 KOs) and losing 21. Rocky was proud that he never had his nose broken in any of his
        amateur fighting career. His nickname is the Italian Stallion, from his Italian-American heritage.</p>

    <p>Fish are a diverse group of aquatic animals that are primarily characterized by their gills, fins, and scales.
        They play essential roles in ecosystems and are important to human culture and diet. Here are some key points
        about fish:

        1. Classification
        Fish are broadly classified into three main groups:
        Jawless Fish (Agnatha): Includes species like lampreys and hagfish.
        Cartilaginous Fish (Chondrichthyes): Includes sharks, rays, and skates, which have skeletons made of cartilage.
        Bony Fish (Osteichthyes): The largest group, including species like salmon, trout, and goldfish, characterized
        by a bony skeleton.
        2. Habitat
        Fish can be found in a wide range of aquatic environments, including oceans, rivers, lakes, and even some
        brackish waters.
        3. Diet
        Fish exhibit various feeding habits:
        Herbivores: Eat plants and algae (e.g., parrotfish).
        Carnivores: Eat other fish and animals (e.g., pike).
        Omnivores: Eat both plants and animals (e.g., catfish).
        4. Reproduction
        Most fish reproduce by laying eggs, but some, like certain sharks and livebearers (e.g., guppies), give birth to
        live young.
        5. Importance to Humans
        Food Source: Fish are a major source of protein for billions of people worldwide.
        Economy: Fishing is a significant industry, contributing to the livelihoods of many communities.
        Recreation: Sport fishing and aquarium keeping are popular activities.
        6. Conservation
        Many fish species face threats from overfishing, habitat destruction, and climate change. Conservation efforts
        are crucial for maintaining fish populations and aquatic ecosystems.</p>

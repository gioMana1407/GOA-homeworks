    <h1>List</h1>
    <p>A list is a set of discrete items of information collected and set forth in some format for utility,
        entertainment, or other purposes. A list may be memorialized in any number of ways, including existing only in
        the mind of the list-maker, but lists are frequently written down on paper, or maintained electronically. Lists
        are "most frequently a tool", and "one does not read but only uses a list: one looks up the relevant information
        in it, but usually does not need to deal with it as a whole".[1]</p>

        <p><u>Breaking Bad</u> is an American crime drama television series created and produced by Vince Gilligan for
            AMC. Set and filmed in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the series follows Walter White (Bryan Cranston), an
            underpaid, dispirited high-school chemistry teacher struggling with a recent diagnosis of stage-three lung
            cancer. White turns to a life of crime and partners with a former student, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), to
            produce and distribute methamphetamine to secure his family's financial future before he dies, while
            navigating the dangers of the criminal underworld. Breaking Bad premiered on AMC on January 20, 2008, and
            concluded on September 29, 2013, after five seasons consisting of 62 episodes.

            Among the show's co-stars are Anna Gunn and RJ Mitte as Walter's wife Skyler and son Walter Jr., and Betsy
            Brandt and Dean Norris as Skyler's sister Marie Schrader and her husband Hank, a DEA agent. Others include
            Bob Odenkirk as Walter's and Jesse's lawyer Saul Goodman, Jonathan Banks as private investigator and fixer
            Mike Ehrmantraut, and Giancarlo Esposito as drug kingpin Gus Fring. The final season introduces Jesse
            Plemons as the criminally ambitious Todd Alquist, and Laura Fraser as Lydia Rodarte-Quayle, a cunning
            business executive.</p>

        <p>Walter Hartwell White Sr., also known by his alias Heisenberg, is the fictional antihero[a] turned villain
            protagonist of the American crime drama television series Breaking Bad, portrayed by Bryan Cranston.

            White is a skilled chemist who co-founded a technology firm before he accepted a buy-out from his partners.
            While his partners became wealthy, Walter became a high school chemistry teacher in Albuquerque, barely
            making ends meet with his family: his wife Skyler (Anna Gunn) and son Walter Jr. (RJ Mitte). At the start of
            the series, the day after his 50th birthday, White is diagnosed with Stage III lung cancer. After this
            discovery, White decides to manufacture and sell methamphetamine with a former student, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron
            Paul), to ensure his family's financial security after his death. Due to his expertise, White's "blue meth"
            is purer than any other on the market, and he is pulled deeper into the illicit drug trade.

            White becomes increasingly ruthless and unsympathetic as the series progresses, as series creator Vince
            Gilligan wanted him to turn from "Mr. Chips into Scarface". He adopts the alias "Heisenberg", which becomes
            recognizable as a kingpin figure in the Southwestern drug trade. White struggles with managing his family
            while hiding his involvement in the drug business from his brother-in-law, DEA agent Hank Schrader (Dean
            Norris). Although AMC officials initially hesitated to cast Cranston due to his previous comedic role on
            Malcolm in the Middle, Gilligan cast him based on the actor's past performance in The X-Files episode
            "Drive", which Gilligan wrote. Cranston contributed greatly to the creation of his character, including
            White's backstory, personality, and physical appearance.

            Both the character and Cranston's performance have received critical acclaim, with Walter White frequently
            being mentioned as one of the greatest and most iconic television characters of all time. Cranston won four
            Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series, three of them being consecutive. He is
            the first man to win a Critics' Choice, Golden Globe, Primetime Emmy, and Screen Actors Guild Award for his
            performance. Cranston reprised the role of Walt in a flashback for Breaking Bad's sequel film El Camino, and
            again in the sixth and final season of the prequel series Better Call Saul, making him one of the few
            characters to appear in all three, alongside Jesse Pinkman, Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks), Ed Galbraith
            (Robert Forster), and Austin Ramey (Todd Terry).</p>

        <p>Jesse Bruce Pinkman is a fictional character in the American crime drama television series Breaking Bad,
            portrayed by Aaron Paul. He is a crystal meth cook and dealer who works with his former high school
            chemistry teacher, Walter White (played by Bryan Cranston). Jesse is the only character besides Walter to
            appear in every episode of the show. Paul reprised the role for the 2019 spin-off sequel film El Camino: A
            Breaking Bad Movie, set after its finale, and again in 2022 for the sixth and final season of the spin-off
            prequel sequel series Better Call Saul, being one of the few characters to appear across both shows and the
            movie.[1]

            Despite initial plans to kill off the character at the end of the first season, Paul's performance convinced
            the showrunner and head writer Vince Gilligan to keep Jesse in the show.[2] The character and Paul's
            performance received acclaim from critics and fans. Critics especially praised Jesse's character development
            from an unsympathetic drug dealer to the moral compass of the show as he becomes increasingly guilty and
            remorseful for his and Walter White's actions while involved in the drug trade.[3] For his portrayal, Paul
            won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2010, 2012, and 2014,
            making him the first actor to win the category three times since its separation into drama and comedy.

            In-universe biography
            Pre-Breaking Bad
            Jesse Bruce Pinkman[4] was born into a middle-class family in Albuquerque, New Mexico. At the time the
            series starts, he has long been estranged from his parents due to his drug addiction and lifestyle as a drug
            dealer. After being forced to leave his parents' residence, Jesse moved in with his Aunt Ginny, for whom he
            cared until her death from cancer; as a result, he became very knowledgeable about the disease. Afterward,
            he was allowed to stay in her home, the ownership of which fell to Jesse's parents.

            Jesse was a poor student in high school and preferred hanging out with his friends and smoking marijuana to
            studying. Walter White, whom Jesse almost always calls "Mr. White", was his chemistry teacher and gave Jesse
            a failing grade in his class. Walt himself later says that he never thought Jesse would amount to much,[5]
            although Jesse's mother Diane (Tess Harper) recalls that Walt "must have seen some potential in Jesse; he
            really tried to motivate him. He was one of the few teachers who cared."[6] Despite his poor academic
            standing, Jesse was able to graduate, with Walt present on stage when he received his diploma.[7]

            In his first chronological appearance, which took place in 2004 during the Better Call Saul episode
            "Waterworks", Jesse is outside of Saul Goodman's office when Kim Wexler (Rhea Seehorn) emerges after having
            signed their divorce papers. As Jesse takes a cigarette from Kim, he recognizes her as the public defender
            who got his friend Christian "Combo" Ortega out of trouble after he stole the Baby Jesus from a Nativity
            display. Jesse is there with Emilio Koyama, who decided to hire Saul based on a TV advertisement. Jesse asks
            Kim if Saul is a good lawyer, to which she replies, "when I knew him, he was."[8]</p>

        <p>Gustavo Fring is a fictional character portrayed by Giancarlo Esposito in the Breaking Bad franchise, serving
            as the main antagonist in the crime drama series Breaking Bad and a major character in its prequel Better
            Call Saul. He is a Chilean-American businessman and major narcotics distributor in the Southwestern United
            States who uses several legitimate businesses, including a chain of successful fast food restaurants called
            Los Pollos Hermanos (The Chicken Brothers) and an industrial laundry facility called Lavandería Brillante
            (Bright Laundry), as fronts used to launder money for a vast drug operation.

            Though outwardly he works with the Mexican cartel to distribute cocaine, he secretly plots revenge against
            its members over the death of his business associate and romantic partner Maximino "Max" Arciniega at the
            hands of his sworn archenemy Hector Salamanca, the patriarch of the cartel-backed drug trade in the
            Southwest. To become independent of the cartel's meth, he constructs a secret lab under his industrial
            laundry to manufacture methamphetamine.

            Fring was created as a character to replace that of Tuco Salamanca (played by departing actor Raymond Cruz)
            during the second season of Breaking Bad. Gus, as a stoic businessman, was created to be opposite to the
            chaotic Tuco and act as a foil to protagonist Walter White. The character has received high acclaim, with
            critics hailing Gus as one of the best villains in television; as such, Esposito's performance in the role
            has earned him several nominations and awards.</p>

        <p>Michael Ehrmantraut (/ˈɜːrməntraʊt/)[1] is a fictional character portrayed by Jonathan Banks in the
            television series Breaking Bad and its spinoff prequel Better Call Saul.[2] Mike is a former Philadelphia
            police officer and United States Marine Corps veteran who works for Gus Fring—and, on occasion, Saul
            Goodman—as a private investigator, head of security, cleaner, and hitman. While an officer in Philadelphia,
            he engaged in corrupt activities that indirectly led to the death of his son Matt, leading Mike to move to
            Albuquerque to watch over and financially support his daughter-in-law Stacey and granddaughter Kaylee
            through jobs in the criminal underworld.

            Mike as a character has been praised by critics and Banks' performance has received several acting awards
            and nominations.</p>

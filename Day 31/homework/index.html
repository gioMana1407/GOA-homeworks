        <p>Clint Eastwood is an American film actor, film director, film producer, singer, composer and lyricist. He has
            appeared in over 60 films. His career has spanned 65 years and began with small uncredited film roles and
            television appearances.[1] Eastwood has acted in multiple television series, including the eight-season
            series Rawhide (1959-1965). Although he appeared in several earlier films, mostly uncredited, his breakout
            film role was as the Man with No Name in the Sergio Leone-directed Dollars Trilogy: A Fistful of Dollars
            (1964), For a Few Dollars More (1965), and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966), which weren't released in
            the United States until 1967/68.[2] In 1971, Eastwood made his directorial debut with Play Misty for Me.[3]
            Also that year, he starred as San Francisco police inspector Harry Callahan in Dirty Harry. The film
            received critical acclaim, and spawned four more films: Magnum Force (1973), The Enforcer (1976), Sudden
            Impact (1983), and The Dead Pool (1988).[4]

            In 1973, Eastwood starred in another western, High Plains Drifter. Three years later, he starred as
            Confederate guerrilla and outlaw Josey Wales in The Outlaw Josey Wales. In 1978, Eastwood starred opposite
            an orangutan in the action-comedy Every Which Way but Loose. Although it received largely negative
            reviews,[5] the film was a financial success, his highest-grossing film at that time, and generated a
            sequel.[6] In 1979, Eastwood portrayed prisoner Frank Morris in the Don Siegel-directed Escape from
            Alcatraz.

            Eastwood's debut as a producer began in 1982 with two films, Firefox and Honkytonk Man.[7] In 1985, Eastwood
            directed Pale Rider, which was the highest-grossing western of the 1980s.[8] Eastwood also has contributed
            music to his films, either through performing or composing. He received the Academy Award for Best Director
            and Best Picture for his 1992 western Unforgiven.[9] In 2003, Eastwood directed an ensemble cast, including
            Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon, Laurence Fishburne, Marcia Gay Harden, and Laura Linney, in Mystic
            River.[10] For their performances, Penn and Robbins respectively won Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor,
            making Mystic River the first film to win both categories since Ben Hur in 1959.[11] In 2004, Eastwood once
            again won the Academy Awards for Best Picture and Director, this time for Million Dollar Baby starring
            Hilary Swank.[12] In 2006, he directed the companion war films Flags of Our Fathers and Letters from Iwo
            Jima, which depict the Battle of Iwo Jima from the perspectives of the U.S. and Japan, respectively.[13] In
            2008, Eastwood directed and starred as protagonist Walt Kowalski in Gran Torino. His most recent acting role
            was for the film Cry Macho (2021), which he also directed and produced for Warner Bros. Pictures, a studio
            he worked with from 1971 up until 2024 for Juror No. 2.

            Throughout his career, Eastwood has received numerous accolades. In 1996, Eastwood was a recipient of the
            AFI Life Achievement Award.[14] In 2006, he received the Stanley Kubrick Britannia Award for Excellence in
            Film from the BAFTA.[15] A 2009 recipient, he was awarded the National Medal of Arts in 2010, the highest
            such honor given by the United States government.[16]</p>

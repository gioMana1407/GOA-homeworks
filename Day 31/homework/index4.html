        <p>Indiana Jones is an American media franchise consisting of five films and a prequel television series, along
            with games, comics, and tie-in novels, that depicts the adventures of Dr. Henry Walton "Indiana" Jones Jr.
            (portrayed in all films by Harrison Ford), a fictional professor of archaeology.

            The series began in 1981 with the film Raiders of the Lost Ark. In 1984, a prequel, Indiana Jones and the
            Temple of Doom, was released, and in 1989, a sequel, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. A fourth film
            followed in 2008, titled Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. A fifth and final film, titled
            Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, was theatrically released on June 30, 2023. The series was
            created by George Lucas. The first four films were directed by Steven Spielberg, who worked closely with
            Lucas during their production, while the fifth film was directed by James Mangold. In 1992, the franchise
            expanded to a television series with The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, exploring the character in his
            childhood and youth, and including adventures with his parents.

            Marvel Comics began publishing The Further Adventures of Indiana Jones in 1983, and Dark Horse Comics gained
            the comic book rights to the character in 1991. Novelizations of the films have been published, as well as
            many novels with original adventures, including a series of German novels by Wolfgang Hohlbein, twelve
            novels set before the films published by Bantam Books, and a series set during the character's childhood
            inspired by the television show. Numerous Indiana Jones video games have been released since 1982.</p>
